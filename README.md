# HTML-Parsing-Expected-Value-Calculator-Chrome-Extension

-This chrome extension was built to automatically parse and calculate expected values from current page html content by using a smart selector system. 
-This extension is designed to work on sites that display odds with corresponding values, and can also take in a comparative values to calculate a "real value" if needed. 
-Additionally, this extension does have button functionality, although it is currently hard coded and not flexible, as is the case with values/odds/cv arrays, and also, it does have an automation feature included with logs.

-To install this extension, turn on developer tools in chrome and load an unpacked extension.
